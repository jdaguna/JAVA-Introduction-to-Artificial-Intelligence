*  The Uniform Cost Search algorithm works correctly in common cases.

*  The Uniform Cost Search algorithm correctly handles unreachable goals.

*  The Uniform Cost Search algorithm performs repeated state checking correctly.

*  The Greedy Search algorithm returns an incorrect solution for some test cases.

*  The Greedy Search algorithm correctly handles unreachable goals.

*  The Greedy Search algorithm does not handle one-way streets correctly.

*  The Greedy Search algorithm does not perform repeated state checking correctly.

*  The A* Search algorithm works correctly in common cases.

*  The A* Search algorithm correctly handles unreachable goals.

*  The A* Search algorithm does not perform repeated state checking correctly.

*  The code was well written and the use of comments made it easier to read and follow.

*  The provided heuristic function is not admissible.  Specifically,
   it uses a distance measure for the residual path cost, while these
   path costs are to be measured in time.
